# Create a Website Using bootstrap5-template

[bootstrap5-template](https://github.com/thecdil/bootstrap5-template) is a basic template repository to create a [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) site using Jekyll on GitHub Pages (or where every you want to host it). 
The layout is based on the [Bootstrap starter template example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/examples/) with a navbar, search box (using lunr.js), and sticky footer.
It is intended as a quick starting point for creating new web projects.

The basic steps for using bootstrap-template are: 

1. create a new repository from the template
2. edit _config.yml
3. edit content pages
4. use customization options

## Set Up Repository

- Visit bootstrap5-template: <https://github.com/thecdil/bootstrap5-template>
- Make your own copy of the repository by clicking the green "Use this template" button (alternatively, use Import or manually copy files to a new repo).
    - Since the repository name will become part of the site URL, use a sensible name with no spaces or odd characters (dash or underscore are okay).
- Activate GitHub Pages. 
    - On your repository visit "Settings", click "Pages" on the side menu.
    - In the "GitHub Pages" settings, under "Source" select Branch "main" from the drop down, and click Save. 
    - Once activated, it will provide your new URL, following the pattern `https://username.github.io/repository_name`

## Edit _config.yml

The file "_config.yml" contains the central variables Jekyll uses to fill in template elements in your site.
Edit `_config.yml` with your site information:

- `title` will appear in the navbar with link to home page.
- `description`, `author`, and `year` appear in footer and meta tags.
- `search` can be set to `true` / `false`, true will include a search box in the navbar. The search box will search site content using lunr.js.
- URL variables (`url` and `baseurl`) are optional if using GitHub Pages, but should be filed in if hosting else where.
- Set `noindex` to `true` if you do NOT want Google to index your site.
- Leave the Build settings section as is.

## Edit Content Pages

Edit and create pages in the "pages" folder.
Generally this will be done using Markdown (files with extension `.md`) or HTML (`.html`).
To include them in the navbar, add front matter option `nav` with the text you want to be displayed, e.g. `nav: Demo`.
Alternatively, if `nav: true` page will show up in navbar using the page `title`.
Use `nav_order` to control order of pages in the navbar.

Front matter options:

- `title` will appear as h1 at top of the page content (when using `page`, `page-full-width`, or `page-narrow` layouts only).
- `nav` if this option has a value, it will appear in the navbar as link to this page. (any stub without a `nav` value will not appear in the navbar)
- `nav_order` navbar items will be sorted using this number. 
- `layout` by default is set to `page`, but can be optionally added to override the default. Built in options are `default`, `page`, `page-full-width`, or `page-narrow`.

Use "includes" to simplify adding Bootstrap features to Markdown pages, see comments in `_include/` files for instructions.

## Customization Options

bootstrap-template has a few built in customization options enabling you to quickly tweak the template theme:

- Tweak base variables in `assets/css/main.scss` (text color, link color, container size). The variables in this file work with `_sass/_template.scss` to set some default options.
- Add custom CSS to `_sass/_custom.scss`. Styles in this file will override the template and bootstrap.
- Paste your analytics snippet into "_includs/template/analytics.html" to add tracking code.

Once you exhaust the possibilities of these built in options, checkout the `_layouts/` and `_includes/template/` folders. 
These files provide the basic template and can be easily tweaked using Bootstrap classes.

## Custom Head and Foot Includes

If you would like to add custom content to head (e.g. external css, fonts) or foot (e.g. js, external js) of only specific pages or layouts, you can use the `head` or `foot` option in the page front matter to specify an "_include".
For example:

```
---
head: example-include.html
foot: test-js-include.html
---
```

Using the `head` option will add the specified include file in the head of the html page *between* the template's Bootstrap CSS and custom CSS. 
This means your `head` include will override Bootstrap, but your custom CSS will override the include. 
This is useful for adding external font CDNs or external CSS libraries.

Using the `foot` option will add the specified include file at the bottom of the html page, after loading the Bootstrap JS bundle. 
This means Bootstrap JS will be loaded first and the JS will appear at the optimal location at the bottom of the html. 
This is useful for adding external JS libraries and JS code to add features to a page.

First, set up your include file in "_includes".
Generally these should have the ".html" extension with content ready to be inserted into an html page (i.e. the JS wrapped in `<script>` tags, CSS wrapped in `<style>` tags).
Then add the `head` or `foot` option to your page or layout front matter using the filename of your include including extension (e.g. `head: example.html`).

## Template Assets

Project assets from external sources are included in assets/lib folder:

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 5.3.5
- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) 1.11.3
- [lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/) 2.3.9
- [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes) 5.3.2

They are included in this directory to ensure template projects can be self-contained and could be run with out connections to external dependencies or an internet connection. 
Links to these assets are contained in the `_includes/template/head.html` and `_includes/template/foot.html` files and could easily be replaced by CDN links if desired.
